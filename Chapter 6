Chapter 6: Bayesian Hypothesis Testing & Model Comparison

How do we decide between two competing hypotheses or models? The Bayesian framework uses the Bayes factor to quantify the evidence provided by the data.

6.1 The Bayes Factor

The Bayes factor (K) is the ratio of the evidence (or marginal likelihood) for two competing models, M₁ and M₂: **K = P(Data | M₁) / P(Data | M₂) **
Interpretation:
K > 1: The data are more likely under M₁. The data provide evidence for M₁.
K < 1: The data are more likely under M₂. The data provide evidence for M₂.
K ≈ 1: The data do not strongly distinguish between the two models.
A key advantage is that, unlike p-values, a Bayes factor can quantify evidence for a null hypothesis (e.g., a K of 1/10 means the null is 10 times more likely than the alternative).

6.2 Code Example: Calculating a Bayes Factor

Calculating Bayes factors can be complex. For simple models, we can use the Savage-Dickey density ratio. To test a point null hypothesis (e.g., p = 0.5), the Bayes factor is simply the ratio of the posterior density to the prior density at the point of interest.
Python

from scipy.stats import beta

# Test M1: p = 0.5 vs M2: p is unknown
# We use the results from our coin flip example.
# Posterior is Beta(9, 5), Prior was Beta(2, 2).

# The point we are testing
p_null = 0.5

# Height of the posterior density at p=0.5
posterior_density_at_null = beta.pdf(p_null, a=9, b=5)

# Height of the prior density at p=0.5
prior_density_at_null = beta.pdf(p_null, a=2, b=2)

# Calculate the Bayes Factor in favor of the alternative (M2) over the null (M1)
# Note: For this to be valid, the prior under M2 must be used. Our Beta(2,2) works.
BF_10 = prior_density_at_null / posterior_density_at_null # BF in favor of null

print(f"Prior height at p=0.5: {prior_density_at_null:.3f}")
print(f"Posterior height at p=0.5: {posterior_density_at_null:.3f}")
print(f"Bayes Factor (K) in favor of the FAIR COIN model: {BF_10:.3f}")

if BF_10 > 1:
    print("The evidence favors the fair coin model.")
else:
    print("The evidence favors the biased coin model.")
